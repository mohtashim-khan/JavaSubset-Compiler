# CPSC 411 Compiler

Run Instructions:
1) use makefile and bison to build the compiler using the command "cd src/ && bison parser.ypp && cd .. && make release"
2) use command "./output filepath" to compile assembly -> the output for this assembley can be found in output.asm.
3) use command "~aycock/411/bin/spim -f output.asm" to run the Assembly files on the CPSC machines.

**TEST RESULTS**
The Final test results can be found in the directory marked "Results". All .asm files are the generated assembly files, whilst the .out files correspond to output files.
